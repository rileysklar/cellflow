## 🔒 Authenticated Experience

The application provides a complete authenticated user experience with the following features:

### User Authentication Flow
- **Sign Up/Sign In**: Secure authentication powered by Clerk with pre-built routes at `/login` and `/signup`
- **User Profile**: Access and management of user information
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware-based route protection that redirects unauthenticated users
- **Role-Based Access**: Support for different user permission levels

### Authenticated View Structure
The authenticated application area follows a consistent layout pattern:
- **App Sidebar**: Navigation sidebar with collapsible menu for different sections
- **Content Area**: Main content display with dedicated header for each section
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop

The authenticated layout is automatically applied to protected routes like `/contacts` and provides a foundation for building additional authenticated features. The structure is designed to be easily extended with new routes while maintaining a consistent user experience.

## 📋 Contacts Feature (Template Example)

The Contacts feature is included as a comprehensive example of a full-stack feature implementation that demonstrates the template's patterns and capabilities:

### What's Included
- **Database Schema**: Complete `contacts` table with relationships to users
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete contact records
- **Server Actions**: Type-safe database operations with proper error handling
- **UI Components**: 
  - Contact form with validation
  - Contact list with search and filtering
  - Inline editing and deletion of contacts
  - Responsive grid layout for contacts

### Purpose of the Contacts Feature
This feature serves as a reference implementation that demonstrates:
- How to structure full-stack features using the template
- Proper data flow between client and server
- Implementation of database operations with Drizzle ORM
- Form validation and error handling patterns
- UI component organization and reuse

The Contacts feature is intentionally simple but complete, providing a solid foundation for understanding how all parts of the tech stack work together. You can use this as a blueprint for your own features or replace it entirely with your application-specific functionality.

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Database**: Utilizes the `contacts` table with fields for name, email, phone, and notes
- **Actions**: Server actions in `actions/db/contacts-actions.ts` for CRUD operations
- **Components**: UI components in `app/contacts/_components/` for the contact list and navigation
- **Layout**: Authenticated layout in `app/contacts/layout.tsx` that includes the app sidebar
- **Page**: Main page component in `app/contacts/page.tsx` that fetches and displays contacts

This implementation follows best practices for Next.js App Router, React Server Components, and client-side state management while providing a seamless user experience.

## 🤖 Cursor Rules

This project includes AI assistant guidelines in the `.cursor/rules/` directory that help AI tools understand the codebase's patterns and conventions. These rules cover:

- **Frontend**: Component structure, naming, and data flow patterns
- **Backend**: Database schema design and server action implementations
- **Auth**: User authentication and authorization practices
- **Storage**: File upload and management guidelines

When using Cursor, these rules are automatically loaded to help the AI generate code that follows the project's conventions and best practices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need free accounts with these services:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Database
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) - Authentication
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - Recommended editor
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Deployment (optional)

### Setup Process

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/materialize-labs/ai-optimized-starter-app.git
   cd ai-optimized-starter-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Edit `.env.local` with your service credentials:

   ```
   # Database (Supabase)
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres

   # Authentication (Clerk)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/login
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/signup
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase**
   Follow the Supabase setup instructions below.

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🗃️ Supabase Setup

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Sign in to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Set a secure database password
4. Choose your preferred region
5. Wait for the project to initialize (about 2 minutes)

### 2. Configure Database Connection

1. Go to Project Settings → Database
2. Copy the connection string from the "URI" section
3. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password
4. Add this URL to your `.env.local` file as `DATABASE_URL`

### 3. Set Up Command Line Tools

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to your Supabase account
supabase login

# Link to your project (find project ref in the URL)
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

Apply the included database migrations to set up the required tables:

```bash
# For development environments
supabase db reset

# For production environments (only applies new migrations)
supabase db push
```

The migrations will create:
- `profiles` table - Stores user profile information
- `contacts` table - Stores contact information for the example app

### 5. Troubleshooting Database Issues

If you see errors like "relation does not exist":

1. Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct
2. Check migration status:
   ```bash
   supabase migration list
   ```
3. Manually push migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

1. Create a [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
2. Create a new application in Clerk dashboard
3. Navigate to API Keys in settings
4. Copy the Publishable Key and Secret Key
5. Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   ```

## 🧠 Development Workflow

This template is optimized for AI-pair programming using Cursor:

1. **Explore with AI**: Use Cursor's AI assistant to understand the codebase
2. **Follow Conventions**: Cursor will follow the patterns defined in .cursor/rules
3. **Rapid Iteration**: Get AI-generated boilerplate for new features
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides end-to-end type safety

When implementing new features:

1. Define database schema in `db/schema/`
2. Create server actions in `actions/db/`
3. Build UI components in `components/`
4. Create pages in `app/`

  /components               # Global shared components
    /ui                     # UI components (Button, Card, etc.)
    /landing                # Landing page components
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, ShadCN UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Deployment**: Fly.io, Docker

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Component Organization

We follow a route-based component organization approach:

- Route-specific components are located in `_components` directories within their respective routes
- Shared UI components are in `lib/components/ui`
- Global reusable components are in `lib/components`

This structure ensures clear separation of concerns and improves maintainability.
